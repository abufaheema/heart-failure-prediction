# heart-failure-prediction

This project aims to predict what causes the people death event either its heart failure or not using machine learning models. 

###  **Dataset**
- Describe the dataset used, including its source, features, and how it's structured.
  

```markdown
## Dataset

The dataset used in this project Heart Failure Prediction downloaded from kaggle.com

 **Features:** The dataset contains 13features.
 **Target Variable:** The target variable is `death_event`, which indicates whether the person die by heart failure or not.

## Model Training

- **Preprocessing:** Data was normalized to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model's predictions.
- **Model:** Logistic Regression','SVC','KNearestNeighbors','Decision Tree','Naive Bayes','Random Forest was used for prediction, in other to know the best algorithms with the highest percentage that will be use in predicting.


### 7. **Results**
- Present the model's performance metrics, with the accuracy score.

```markdown
## Results

The Decision Tree Classifier achieved an accuracy of 88.89% on the test set. Below are the detailed performance metrics:
